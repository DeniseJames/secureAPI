            <p className="fst-italic, mb-3">"Denise James worked in my department at Honda R&D, providing software integration and data management services to engine, emission control, and electrical departments during 2013 and 2014. Denise is highly capable and knowledgeable about system integration and vehicle control software, and she provided extraordinary support across departments to a diverse group of engineers. She chaired weekly meetings with sub-system engineers to keep software development on schedule and to ensure accurate data for software release. Furthermore, she regularly found areas for process improvement and suggested effective countermeasures for improving data accuracy and work efficiency. I would not hesitate to work with Denise again, and I can unequivocally recommend her based on quality of work and tenacity towards goals."</p>

            <p className="fst-italic">"Denise James was my colleague at Honda Research and Development. We worked together constantly at work on vehicle software integration. Denise is one out of five people in the country that can do the vehicle software integration she does. Denise was tenacious and extremely knowledgeable about system vehicle software. She chaired an efficient weekly meeting with sub system engineers to release accurate software quickly. She kept the team on task with electronic vehicle software schedules on a shared secure location. I will never forget the time another team member was unavailable for an issue with the software in a vehicle launch. Denise stepped up to communicate the concern with the supplier in Japan to release updated software within twelve hours to keep the vehicle launch on time. I highly recommend Denise and would enjoy working with her again."</p>
